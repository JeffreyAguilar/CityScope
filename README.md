# CityScope

A team project where we designed a cross platform mobile app using Flutter/Dart that provides services and recommendations for the best places to go and things to do around a userâ€™s location. Our application is designed to give users the best ability to explore and view the cities that they travel to. We believe that the key for users to have the best experience traveling and exploring is simplicity and maintaining and perfecting the key elements of what is important for the user. In this case, the most important elements of our app are the location services (e.g live map and location tracking) and the ability to view and rate local businesses. The app also recommends the best local places for the user to visit based on the ratings given by users and previous data taken from the Yelp API.
